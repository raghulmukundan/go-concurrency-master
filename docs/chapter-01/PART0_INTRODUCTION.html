var __PAGE_CONTENT__ = "# Chapter 1, Part 0: Introduction and Setup\n\n**Time to complete**: 10 minutes  \n**Prerequisites**: Basic Go syntax (variables, functions, loops)\n\n---\n\n## Section 0.1: What We're Building\n\n### The Real-World Problem\n\nImagine you work at a company building a web analytics service (like Google Analytics). Your job is to count how many times each URL on a website gets visited.\n\n**Here's what happens:**\n1. Someone visits `https://example.com/products`\n2. Your server receives the hit\n3. You need to increment the counter for that URL\n4. Repeat for millions of requests per second\n\n**Real companies doing this:**\n- Google Analytics (tracks billions of page views)\n- Cloudflare (tracks requests to millions of websites)\n- Your company's own analytics dashboard\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nLet's say you're tracking hits for 1 million different URLs. On a busy day:\n- 100,000 requests per second total\n- Each request needs to update one counter\n- You need to do this **fast** and **accurately**\n\n**If you're too slow:**\n- Requests queue up\n- Your server crashes\n- You miss data\n\n**If you're inaccurate:**\n- Customer sees wrong numbers\n- Business decisions are made on bad data\n- You get fired (okay, maybe not, but still bad!)\n\n### What Success Looks Like\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you'll build a counter that:\n- ✅ Handles 100,000+ increments per second\n- ✅ Never loses a single count\n- ✅ Uses multiple CPU cores effectively\n- ✅ Works correctly under high concurrency\n\n---\n\n## Section 0.2: The Challenge\n\n### Why Sequential Processing is Too Slow\n\nHere's a simple approach (we'll code this soon):\n\n```go\n// Pseudocode - don't run yet!\nfor each request {\n    url := request.URL\n    counts[url]++  // Increment the counter\n}\n```\n\n**Problem**: This is sequential - one request at a time.\n\nIf each increment takes 1 microsecond (0.001 milliseconds):\n- 1 request = 1 microsecond\n- 100,000 requests = 100,000 microseconds = **100 milliseconds**\n\nThat's **10 requests per second**! We need 100,000 per second!\n\n### The Solution: Concurrent Processing\n\nInstead of processing one at a time, process many simultaneously:\n\n```go\n// Pseudocode - still don't run yet!\nfor each request {\n    go func() {  // Process in parallel\n        url := request.URL\n        counts[url]++\n    }()\n}\n```\n\nNow we can process 100,000 requests at once! Problem solved, right?\n\n**WRONG!** This code has a devastating bug. And that's what this chapter is about.\n\n### What Could Go Wrong?\n\nWhen multiple goroutines try to update `counts[url]` at the same time, terrible things happen:\n\n```\nGoroutine 1: Read count = 42\nGoroutine 2: Read count = 42  (Before Goroutine 1 writes!)\nGoroutine 1: Write count = 43\nGoroutine 2: Write count = 43  (Should be 44!)\n```\n\n**Result**: One count was lost! 🔥\n\nThis is called a **race condition**, and it's one of the most dangerous bugs in programming.\n\n---\n\n## Section 0.3: Our Learning Journey\n\nHere's the path we'll take:\n\n### Step 1: Build It The Simple Way\n- Write sequential code that works\n- Understand why it's too slow\n- Establish a baseline\n\n### Step 2: Break It Spectacularly\n- Make it concurrent (naive approach)\n- Watch it produce wrong answers\n- See the race condition in action\n- Use Go's race detector to find the bug\n\n### Step 3: Understand WHY It Broke\n- Learn what race conditions are\n- Understand memory and caches\n- Visualize what's happening\n\n### Step 4: Fix It (Three Different Ways)\n**Solution 1: Channels**\n- Learn what channels are\n- Use channels to prevent the race\n- Understand channel internals\n\n**Solution 2: Mutexes**\n- Learn what mutexes are\n- Use locks to protect the counter\n- Understand mutex internals\n\n**Solution 3: Atomics**\n- Learn atomic operations\n- Use atomic increments\n- Understand CPU-level atomics\n\n### Step 5: Compare and Choose\n- Benchmark all three solutions\n- Learn when to use each\n- Make production-ready decisions\n\n---\n\n## Section 0.4: What You'll Learn\n\nBy completing this chapter, you will:\n\n**Core Skills:**\n- ✅ Identify race conditions in code\n- ✅ Use the Go race detector\n- ✅ Fix races with channels, mutexes, or atomics\n- ✅ Choose the right tool for the job\n\n**Deep Understanding:**\n- 🧠 How goroutines share memory\n- 🧠 Why operations aren't atomic\n- 🧠 How channels prevent races\n- 🧠 How mutexes provide mutual exclusion\n- 🧠 How atomic operations work at CPU level\n\n**Practical Skills:**\n- 🛠️ Debug concurrent programs\n- 🛠️ Write thread-safe code\n- 🛠️ Benchmark concurrency patterns\n- 🛠️ Make production-ready choices\n\n---\n\n## Section 0.5: How to Use This Chapter\n\n### Reading the Code\n\nAll code examples are **complete and runnable**. You should:\n\n1. **Read** the code first\n2. **Type it out** (don't copy-paste!)\n3. **Run it** and see what happens\n4. **Experiment** by changing things\n\n### The Exercises\n\nAfter each section, you'll find exercises marked with 🏋️.\n\n**Do NOT skip these!** They cement your understanding.\n\n### The Quizzes\n\nQuestions marked with ❓ test your comprehension.\n\nTry to answer before looking at the explanation.\n\n### The \"Stop and Think\" Sections\n\nMarked with 🤔, these are moments to pause and reflect.\n\n**Actually stop and think!** Don't just read through.\n\n---\n\n## Section 0.6: Prerequisites Check\n\nBefore starting, make sure you understand:\n\n### Basic Go Syntax\n```go\n// Can you understand this?\nfunc processData(items []string) map[string]int {\n    counts := make(map[string]int)\n    for _, item := range items {\n        counts[item]++\n    }\n    return counts\n}\n```\n\nIf this looks familiar, you're ready!\n\nIf not, complete \"A Tour of Go\" first: https://go.dev/tour/\n\n### Setting Up Go\n\nMake sure Go is installed:\n```bash\ngo version\n# Should show: go version go1.21 or higher\n```\n\nCreate a working directory:\n```bash\nmkdir ~/go-concurrency-chapter1\ncd ~/go-concurrency-chapter1\n```\n\nInitialize a Go module:\n```bash\ngo mod init chapter1\n```\n\nYou're ready to code!\n\n---\n\n## Section 0.7: A Note on Learning\n\n### This Will Take Time\n\nLearning concurrency properly takes time. Budget:\n- **Reading this chapter**: 4-6 hours\n- **Doing all exercises**: 6-8 hours\n- **Total**: 10-14 hours\n\n**Don't rush!** Better to take 2 weeks and truly understand than to skim in 2 hours.\n\n### When You Get Stuck\n\nIf something doesn't make sense:\n1. Re-read that section\n2. Try the code examples\n3. Draw it out on paper\n4. Take a break and come back\n5. Ask questions in the discussions\n\n### The \"Aha!\" Moment\n\nConcurrency clicks differently for everyone. For some, it's when they:\n- See the race detector output\n- Draw the timeline diagram\n- Watch the broken counter\n- Write their first working concurrent code\n\nYour moment will come. Keep going!\n\n---\n\n## Ready to Start?\n\nTake a deep breath. Grab some coffee (or tea). Make sure you have:\n- ✅ Go installed\n- ✅ A code editor ready\n- ✅ 30-60 minutes of uninterrupted time\n- ✅ A willingness to get your hands dirty with code\n\n**Let's build some concurrent code!** →\n\n[Continue to Part 1: The Sequential Baseline](./PART1_SEQUENTIAL_BASELINE.md)\n";
